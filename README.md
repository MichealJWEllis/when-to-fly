## 1. when-to-fly
Group 7 Project

## 2. Site Decscription
Drones are categorized as Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), which with other kinds of aircrafting  systems are becoming highly available in almost all major electronic retail stores and online marketers. Every user of such technology, be it for business purposes or personal use, desires operating them whenevr, wherever and most especially, making safe operation a priority. Conversely, it is very easy to pick one up from the shelf for use by prospective operators, but without the awareness that, you cant just fly or operate them anytime nor anywhere.
When-To-Fly is a website inspired by a group of University of Texas at Austin Coding BootCamp students, that provides drone users/operators with all the guidance and information required for responsible and safe operation.
